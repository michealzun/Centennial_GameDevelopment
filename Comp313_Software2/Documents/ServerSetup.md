These are the tools you will need for setting up the login/profile server.

 - **Cloud Platform** - Any cloud platform such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform and etc. This project uses Amazon Web Services as the server backend. Find out more about AWS on their [**offical website**](https://aws.amazon.com/).
 
 - **Database Backend** - This project uses [**MongoDB**](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the database.
 
 - **Server Backend** - You will need to install [**Node.js**](https://nodejs.org/en/) and all the necessary modules.

Open command prompt and navigate to the server directory once **Node.js** is installed. Type `npm install` to install all the modules are required.
